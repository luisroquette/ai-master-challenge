# Support Decision Copilot Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: complete `plan-task`, then use `implement-task` to execute this plan task-by-task after Luis approves it. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** Deliver a local, reproducible Support Decision Copilot that diagnoses Dataset 1, demonstrates bounded automation across both datasets, and makes every automated or human-review decision auditable.

**Architecture:** One Python/Streamlit process reads versioned offline artifacts produced by one reproduction command. Small pure-Python modules own data validation, analytics, modeling, risk decisions, retrieval and SQLite audit storage; the UI only orchestrates them. Dataset 1 and Dataset 2 share code paths but never records, labels, splits or models.

**Tech Stack:** Python 3.12; Streamlit; pandas; scikit-learn; joblib; SQLite and `csv`/`json` from the standard library; pytest; Ruff. No paid API, remote model, JavaScript frontend, database service or deployment.

**Spec:** `.specs/tasks/draft/implement-support-decision-copilot.feature.md`

## Global Constraints

- Keep every public artifact under `submissions/luis-roquette/`; never commit raw datasets, PII, credentials, model caches or runtime databases.
- Run heavy install, full test and reproduction gates through `codespace-manager`; local checks remain limited to compilation, Ruff and focused tests.
- Preserve independent 60/20/20 train/calibration/test splits and never tune from frozen-test results.
- Never claim unavailable first-response latency or total-resolution duration; the only duration proxy is the validated interval after first response.
- Never send an external response, learn online, call a paid AI API or merge the taxonomies.
- Never invent Luis's personal profile data; obtain the LinkedIn URL before writing the evaluator-facing README or state `Não informado` explicitly.
- Before every task commit, append a short, corrected-Portuguese process-log entry with decision, files, errors/corrections and verification, then stage that log in the same commit.
- Keep the implementation within the challenge's 4–6 hour budget; remove optional polish before weakening evidence, privacy or tests.

## Review Focus

- Malformed, missing or negative timestamps must be quarantined and counted, never converted to a valid duration.
- Names, emails and phone numbers hidden inside free text must be masked before splits, artifacts, UI, screenshots and exports.
- Missing, corrupt or version-mismatched artifacts must disable only the affected feature and show the exact regeneration command.
- Empty, ambiguous or out-of-distribution text must fall below the locked confidence gate and reach human review.
- Weak or unsafe historical resolutions must produce explicit retrieval abstention instead of a fabricated draft.

## Facts the implementation must preserve

- Dataset 1 has 8,469 rows. It has timestamps for first response and resolution but no ticket-created timestamp; only the interval after first response is derivable for closed tickets.
- Dataset 1 has 5,700 missing resolutions, resolution timestamps and satisfaction ratings. Every metric must publish its denominator.
- Dataset 2 has 47,837 rows, two columns and eight imbalanced classes.
- Dataset 1 is the operational workspace; Dataset 2 remains a separate IT classification laboratory.
- “Automatic” means an eligible routing recommendation. The MVP never transmits a message or closes a ticket.

### Task 1: Lock the environment and reproduce the framework choice

**Estimate:** 20 minutes

**Files:**
- Create: `pyproject.toml`
- Create: `requirements.lock`
- Create: `Makefile`
- Create: `.streamlit/config.toml`
- Modify: `.gitignore`
- Verify: `research/002-support.md`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: Python 3.12, `make`, `curl`, `unzip`, Git and the public Kaggle URLs.
- Produces: `make doctor`, `make setup`, `make data`, `make test`, `make lint`, `make reproduce`, `make app`, `make demo`, plus a frozen `requirements.lock`.

- [ ] **Step 1:** Define one Python 3.12 package with compatible floors `streamlit>=1.64,<2`, `pandas>=2.2,<3`, `scikit-learn>=1.6,<2`, and `joblib>=1.4,<2`; development dependencies are `pytest>=8,<9` and `ruff>=0.11,<1`. The Streamlit floor is explicitly verified for this plan's multipage `AppTest` flow; the scikit-learn floor covers `FrozenEstimator`. `requirements.lock` freezes the exact transitive versions proven in Codespaces. Add Ruff configuration and set pytest `pythonpath = ["src"]` in `pyproject.toml`.
- [ ] **Step 2:** Add `make doctor`, `make bootstrap-lock`, `make setup`, `make data`, `make test`, `make lint`, `make reproduce`, `make app`, and `make demo`. `doctor` checks Python 3.12, `make`, `curl`, `unzip`, writable disk and the two Kaggle endpoints, then prints exact corrections for failures. `bootstrap-lock` is allowed only when `requirements.lock` is absent: it creates `.venv` with Python 3.12, installs `.[dev]`, and writes `.venv/bin/pip freeze --exclude-editable` to the lock. `make setup` requires the committed lock, installs it, then installs the local package with `--no-deps`. `make data` idempotently downloads both public Kaggle archives with `curl -fL`, extracts the two named CSVs into `data/raw/`, verifies filenames and nonzero size, and removes only its downloaded archives. `make reproduce` must call `python scripts/reproduce.py`; `make app` must call `streamlit run app.py`; `make demo` runs doctor, setup, data and reproduction sequentially, then starts the app so a prepared machine needs one command and no credentials.
- [ ] **Step 3:** Extend `.gitignore` with `.venv/`, `data/raw/`, `artifacts/`, `*.sqlite3`, `__pycache__/`, `.pytest_cache/`, and `.ruff_cache/`.
- [ ] **Step 4:** Build the smallest proof in a temporary `app.py`: two `st.Page` entries, one `st.form`, one SQLite insert, and one `st.download_button`. Run it once, then replace it in Task 8; do not add a UI framework abstraction.
- [ ] **Step 5:** Run the focused local smoke check, commit, and push this intermediate feature-branch checkpoint so the managed Codespace can receive the exact files:

```bash
python3 -m compileall -q app.py
git add -f submissions/luis-roquette/research/002-support.md \
  submissions/luis-roquette/solution/002-support/{.gitignore,.streamlit/config.toml,Makefile,pyproject.toml,app.py} \
  submissions/luis-roquette/process-log/002-support.md
git commit -m "chore: lock support copilot environment"
git push -u origin submission/luis-roquette-002-support
```

- [ ] **Step 6:** Validate the pushed checkpoint through the managed Codespace. First, `list` and `triage` must prefer a stopped, clean Codespace for this repository and use `codespace-manager run <returned-name> -- '<command>'`. If none exists, use `create-run` below. When five slots already exist, reclaim one eligible stopped, clean environment under the global lifecycle rule before creating another; never reuse an active or dirty environment.

```bash
codespace-manager list
codespace-manager create-run luisroquette/ai-master-challenge submission/luis-roquette-002-support -- \
  'cd /workspaces/ai-master-challenge/submissions/luis-roquette/solution/002-support && make bootstrap-lock && (.venv/bin/streamlit run app.py --server.headless true >/tmp/support-streamlit.log 2>&1 & pid=$!; curl --retry 20 --retry-delay 1 --retry-connrefused http://127.0.0.1:8501/_stcore/health; kill "$pid"; wait "$pid"; status=$?; test "$status" -eq 143) && cd /workspaces/ai-master-challenge && git add -f submissions/luis-roquette/solution/002-support/requirements.lock && git commit -m "chore: lock support copilot dependencies" && git push'
```

Expected: dependency installation exits 0; the health endpoint responds before the process is terminated deliberately; the lock commit reaches the feature branch. Run `git pull --ff-only` locally before Task 2. If the proof fails, revise the framework decision and this plan before continuing.

### Task 2: Validate, sanitize and split both datasets

**Estimate:** 30 minutes

**Files:**
- Create: `src/support_copilot/__init__.py`
- Create: `src/support_copilot/data.py`
- Create: `tests/test_data.py`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: raw Dataset 1 and Dataset 2 CSV paths.
- Produces: `DatasetSplit`, sanitized frames, stable row identifiers and a source/split manifest used by every later task.

- [ ] **Step 1:** Write failing tests for exact required columns, missing-column errors, stable SHA-256 file fingerprints, PII masking, Dataset 1 timestamp parsing, and independent stratified splits.

```python
def test_sanitize_text_masks_email_phone_and_customer_name():
    value = sanitize_text(
        "Ana Souza, email ana@example.com or call +55 11 99999-8888",
        names=["Ana Souza"],
    )
    assert value == "[NAME], email [EMAIL] or call [PHONE]"


def test_customer_split_keeps_ticket_ids_disjoint():
    split = make_split(customer_frame(), target="Ticket Type", random_state=42)
    assert not (set(split.train["Ticket ID"]) & set(split.test["Ticket ID"]))
```

- [ ] **Step 2:** Run the focused test and confirm it fails because `support_copilot.data` does not exist:

```bash
.venv/bin/pytest tests/test_data.py -q
```

- [ ] **Step 3:** Implement `DatasetSplit(train, calibration, test)` as a frozen dataclass and these exact public functions in `data.py`: `load_customer_tickets(path)`, `load_it_tickets(path)`, `sanitize_text(value, names=())`, `sanitize_customer_frame(frame)`, `make_split(frame, target, random_state=42)`, and `write_manifest(paths, destination)`.

`make_split` uses stratified 60/20/20 partitions. Dataset 1 uses `Ticket ID`; Dataset 2 receives a stable `row_id` equal to SHA-256 of `source_row_number + "\0" + Document` before splitting. Store split row identifiers in the manifest and fail when any identifier overlaps. Do not expose name, email, age or gender beyond the sanitizer.

- [ ] **Step 4:** Run:

```bash
.venv/bin/pytest tests/test_data.py -q
.venv/bin/ruff check src/support_copilot/data.py tests/test_data.py
```

Expected: all data tests pass; Ruff reports no errors.

- [ ] **Step 5:** Commit:

```bash
git add -f submissions/luis-roquette/solution/002-support/src \
  submissions/luis-roquette/solution/002-support/tests/test_data.py \
  submissions/luis-roquette/process-log/002-support.md
git commit -m "feat: validate and sanitize support datasets"
```

### Task 3: Produce honest operational diagnostics

**Estimate:** 45 minutes

**Files:**
- Create: `src/support_copilot/analytics.py`
- Create: `tests/test_analytics.py`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: sanitized Dataset 1 and its frozen row identifiers.
- Produces: quality summary, bottleneck table, waste-opportunity table, satisfaction evidence and scenario outputs with explicit denominators.

- [ ] **Step 1:** Write failing tests that prove denominator reconciliation, missingness counts, the only allowed duration formula, the waste benchmark and the no-signal satisfaction fallback:

```python
def test_post_response_hours_uses_resolution_minus_first_response():
    result = add_operational_fields(closed_ticket_frame())
    assert result.loc[0, "post_response_hours"] == 2.5


def test_summary_reconciles_to_eligible_rows():
    summary = operational_summary(mixed_status_frame())
    assert summary["post_response_hours"]["n"] == 2
    assert summary["post_response_hours"]["missing"] == 1


def test_waste_uses_peer_median_and_never_negative_hours():
    result = recoverable_excess_hours(peer_group_frame())
    assert result["observed_excess_hours"].ge(0).all()
    assert result["eligible_n"].sum() == 4


def test_satisfaction_model_reports_no_signal_when_it_does_not_beat_dummy():
    result = satisfaction_associations(no_signal_frame())
    assert result["status"] == "no_reliable_signal"
```

- [ ] **Step 2:** Confirm failure, then implement these exact functions: `add_operational_fields(frame)`, `grouped_bottlenecks(frame)`, `recoverable_excess_hours(frame)`, `satisfaction_associations(frame)`, `operational_summary(frame)`, and `scenario_projection(summary, assumptions)`.

Use medians, interquartile ranges and counts by channel, priority, ticket type and their combinations. Derive `post_response_hours` only when both timestamps parse, resolution is not earlier than first response, and status is closed; quarantine and count every invalid row instead of coercing it. The inspected source has 1,365 negative intervals among 2,769 timestamp pairs, so the quality report must surface this before any operational finding.

For groups with at least 30 valid rows, define the peer benchmark as the median `post_response_hours` for the same ticket type and priority across all channels. `observed_excess_hours` is the sum of `max(row_hours - peer_median, 0)`; label it an observed opportunity proxy, not causal savings. Do not extrapolate invalid or missing rows.

Report univariate Spearman/group effect sizes, then compare a one-hot encoded Ridge model against `DummyRegressor` by repeated cross-validation on rated, valid rows using only operational fields (`channel`, `ticket type`, `priority`, `product`, `status`, `post_response_hours`). Publish permutation importance only when Ridge improves mean MAE by at least 2%; otherwise return `no_reliable_signal`. `scenario_projection` accepts annual eligible volume, addressable share, minutes saved and loaded hourly cost; it cannot infer cost from the dataset.

- [ ] **Step 3:** Run:

```bash
.venv/bin/pytest tests/test_analytics.py -q
```

Expected: tests pass and no key named `first_response_duration` or `total_resolution_duration` exists.

- [ ] **Step 4:** Commit:

```bash
git add -f submissions/luis-roquette/solution/002-support/src/support_copilot/analytics.py \
  submissions/luis-roquette/solution/002-support/tests/test_analytics.py \
  submissions/luis-roquette/process-log/002-support.md
git commit -m "feat: add traceable support diagnostics"
```

### Task 4: Train separate calibrated classifiers without test leakage

**Estimate:** 50 minutes

**Files:**
- Create: `src/support_copilot/modeling.py`
- Create: `tests/test_modeling.py`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: independent sanitized splits from Task 2.
- Produces: `DomainModel.predict(text) -> Prediction`, locked thresholds, model versions and frozen-test metrics for Customer Support and IT.

- [ ] **Step 1:** Write failing tests for domain separation, model metadata, Dataset 1 subject ablation and threshold selection using calibration rows only.

```python
def test_training_never_reads_frozen_test_rows(monkeypatch):
    split = labeled_split()
    seen = spy_fit_row_ids(monkeypatch)
    train_domain_model("it", split)
    assert set(split.test.index).isdisjoint(seen)


def test_prediction_includes_calibrated_distribution():
    result = fitted_fixture().predict(["cannot access shared drive"])[0]
    assert abs(sum(result.probabilities.values()) - 1.0) < 1e-9
    assert result.model_version


def test_customer_primary_model_excludes_subject_from_features():
    assert customer_feature_columns() == ("Ticket Description",)
```

- [ ] **Step 2:** Implement `Prediction(label, confidence, probabilities, model_version)` as a frozen dataclass and these exact functions: `candidate_pipelines()`, `select_candidate(train, text, target)`, `train_domain_model(domain, split)`, and `evaluate_frozen_test(model, test)`.

Dataset 1 uses `Ticket Description` to predict `Ticket Type`; Dataset 2 uses `Document` to predict `Topic_group`. Run a documented Dataset 1 ablation with `Ticket Subject` added, but never select the subject variant unless the audit proves the subject is not a label proxy and the description-only model already beats baseline. Candidates are `DummyClassifier`, TF-IDF + MultinomialNB, TF-IDF + LogisticRegression, and TF-IDF + LinearSVC. Select by stratified five-fold macro-F1 on `train`; break ties within 0.01 in favor of the simpler/faster candidate. If the winner improves mean CV macro-F1 by less than 0.02 over the dummy baseline, mark that domain `classification_unsupported` and force human review rather than presenting weak automation. Otherwise fit the winner on `train`, calibrate with sigmoid on `calibration` using scikit-learn `FrozenEstimator`, then select the lowest confidence threshold from `0.50, 0.55, …, 0.95` whose calibration-set selective error is at most 10%; if none qualifies, set the threshold to `1.0` so every case receives human review. Lock model and threshold, then evaluate `test` once. Report macro-F1, per-class precision/recall/F1, confusion matrix, multiclass log loss, expected calibration error and risk-versus-coverage points.

- [ ] **Step 3:** Run:

```bash
.venv/bin/pytest tests/test_modeling.py -q
```

Expected: both domain fixtures produce versioned predictions; frozen-test spy observes zero training reads.

- [ ] **Step 4:** Commit:

```bash
git add -f submissions/luis-roquette/solution/002-support/src/support_copilot/modeling.py \
  submissions/luis-roquette/solution/002-support/tests/test_modeling.py \
  submissions/luis-roquette/process-log/002-support.md
git commit -m "feat: train calibrated domain classifiers"
```

### Task 5: Enforce priority, risk precedence and retrieval abstention

**Estimate:** 45 minutes, including two seeded 30-case rubric passes

**Files:**
- Create: `src/support_copilot/decision.py`
- Create: `src/support_copilot/retrieval.py`
- Create: `tests/test_decision.py`
- Create: `tests/test_retrieval.py`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `Prediction`, sanitized Dataset 1 training/calibration/test splits and operational evidence.
- Produces: `RouteDecision`, `TicketRetriever.suggest(text)`, a versioned policy, source IDs/scores and calibrated abstention evidence.

- [ ] **Step 1:** Write failing boundary tests:

```python
def test_critical_rule_beats_high_confidence():
    decision = decide_route(prediction(0.99), TicketSignals(priority="Critical"), threshold=0.80)
    assert decision.action == "human_review"
    assert "critical_priority" in decision.reason_codes


def test_retrieval_abstains_below_validated_threshold():
    result = retriever_fixture(score=0.19).suggest("unseen problem", threshold=0.40)
    assert result.status == "abstain"
    assert result.draft is None
```

- [ ] **Step 2:** Implement `RouteDecision(action, reason_codes)` as a frozen dataclass and these exact functions: `priority_score(priority, confidence, risk_count)`, `decide_route(prediction, signals, threshold)`, `fit_retriever(train_closed)`, and `evaluate_retriever(retriever, unseen, rubric_path)`.

The gate returns human review for invalid/empty/out-of-distribution text, critical priority, explicit sensitive-policy match, confidence below the locked threshold, unsupported classifier, model failure or missing artifact. The versioned policy starts conservatively with Dataset 1 categories `Billing inquiry`, `Refund request`, and `Cancellation request`, plus Dataset 2 categories `HR Support`, `Access`, and `Administrative rights`, as human-only. For every human-only category, publish the rationale, available row count and sanitized example IDs; Dataset 2 rules based on semantic risk rather than operational outcomes must say so explicitly. A rule can block automation but never force it. The priority score is display ordering only: existing priority ordinal first, then risk count, then uncertainty; document this formula in the policy JSON.

The retriever indexes only sanitized, closed Dataset 1 training rows with nonempty resolutions. Use TF-IDF cosine similarity, return at most three source ticket IDs and scores, and copy the top historical resolution as an editable draft only above the calibration-set threshold. On a seeded, ticket-type-stratified sample of 30 eligible calibration queries, review candidate thresholds `0.20, 0.30, …, 0.90` and choose the lowest one with mean correctness and safety of at least 4/5 and zero safety score below 3; if none qualifies, disable drafts and retain source-only retrieval. After locking that decision, use a separate seeded sample of 30 eligible frozen-test queries for final rubric metrics and examples. Never place calibration/test resolutions in the index or tune from frozen-test rubric results.

- [ ] **Step 3:** Add a lightweight `python -m support_copilot.retrieval prepare-review` command and `evidence/retrieval-calibration-rubric.csv` plus `evidence/retrieval-test-rubric.csv` with headers `query_id,source_id,relevance,correctness,safety,edit_effort,reviewer_notes`. Scores are 1–5. After `make data`, run the command locally to sanitize Dataset 1 and emit a seeded 30-row calibration packet under `artifacts/review/`; complete it and copy only IDs, scores and sanitized notes to `evidence/`. Rerun the command to lock the threshold and emit the distinct frozen-test packet; complete it without changing the threshold. Drafts remain disabled until the calibration rubric validates. This local review preparation is bounded to 2,769 closed rows and is not a heavy preflight.
- [ ] **Step 4:** Run:

```bash
.venv/bin/pytest tests/test_decision.py tests/test_retrieval.py -q
```

Expected: every unsafe boundary abstains or requests human review; source IDs and scores remain visible.

- [ ] **Step 5:** Commit:

```bash
git add -f submissions/luis-roquette/solution/002-support/src/support_copilot/{decision,retrieval}.py \
  submissions/luis-roquette/solution/002-support/tests/test_{decision,retrieval}.py \
  submissions/luis-roquette/solution/002-support/evidence/retrieval-{calibration,test}-rubric.csv \
  submissions/luis-roquette/process-log/002-support.md
git commit -m "feat: add bounded routing and response retrieval"
```

### Task 6: Persist an atomic local audit trail

**Estimate:** 20 minutes

**Files:**
- Create: `src/support_copilot/store.py`
- Create: `tests/test_store.py`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: sanitized `DecisionEvent` values from the UI.
- Produces: atomic SQLite decision rows, stable audit IDs, event listing and PII-free CSV bytes.

- [ ] **Step 1:** Write failing tests for schema creation, atomic inserts, preservation after a failed write and PII-free CSV export.
- [ ] **Step 2:** Implement one SQLite table and no repository abstraction:

```sql
CREATE TABLE decisions (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  created_at TEXT NOT NULL,
  ticket_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  domain TEXT NOT NULL,
  data_version TEXT NOT NULL,
  model_version TEXT NOT NULL,
  rules_version TEXT NOT NULL,
  threshold REAL NOT NULL,
  suggested_label TEXT NOT NULL,
  confidence REAL NOT NULL,
  gate_action TEXT NOT NULL,
  reason_codes TEXT NOT NULL,
  human_action TEXT NOT NULL,
  human_reason TEXT,
  suggestion_text TEXT,
  final_text TEXT,
  edit_ratio REAL
);
```

Implement these exact functions around that table: `initialize_store(path)`, `record_decision(connection, event)`, `list_decisions(connection)`, and `export_decisions_csv(connection)`.

Store only sanitized text. Use a transaction per event and JSON arrays for reason codes. Compute `edit_ratio` with `difflib.SequenceMatcher` from suggestion and final text; leave it null for rejection, escalation or abstention. Every CSV row must carry data, model and rules versions plus the applied threshold.

- [ ] **Step 3:** Run:

```bash
.venv/bin/pytest tests/test_store.py -q
```

Expected: rollback test leaves the prior row unchanged; exported headers contain no customer name, email, age or gender.

- [ ] **Step 4:** Commit:

```bash
git add -f submissions/luis-roquette/solution/002-support/src/support_copilot/store.py \
  submissions/luis-roquette/solution/002-support/tests/test_store.py \
  submissions/luis-roquette/process-log/002-support.md
git commit -m "feat: persist auditable support decisions"
```

### Task 7: Build one deterministic reproduction pipeline

**Estimate:** 30 minutes

**Files:**
- Create: `scripts/reproduce.py`
- Create: `tests/test_workflow.py`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: Task 1 commands, Task 2 splits and all Tasks 3–6 pure functions/artifacts.
- Produces: one reproducible artifact tree and fail-closed loading metadata consumed by the Streamlit app.

- [ ] **Step 1:** Write an integration test with small fixtures that executes the pipeline twice and compares artifact hashes except the documented `generated_at` field.
   Add cases for a missing artifact, modified source hash, incompatible artifact version and corrupt joblib file; each must disable only the affected feature and return a message containing artifact path, cause and regeneration command.
- [ ] **Step 2:** Implement this exact CLI:

```text
python scripts/reproduce.py \
  --customer data/raw/customer_support_tickets.csv \
  --it data/raw/all_tickets_processed_improved_v3.csv \
  --output artifacts
```

The command must produce:

```text
artifacts/
├── manifest.json
├── risk-policy.json
├── analytics/operational-summary.json
├── analytics/bottlenecks.csv
├── analytics/waste-opportunities.csv
├── analytics/satisfaction-associations.csv
├── analytics/satisfaction-model.json
├── analytics/automation-opportunities.csv
├── models/customer.joblib
├── models/it.joblib
├── models/metrics.json
├── retrieval/customer.joblib
├── retrieval/metrics.json
├── review/retrieval-calibration-template.csv
├── review/retrieval-test-template.csv
└── queue/customer-test.csv
```

`customer-test.csv` contains only sanitized frozen-test rows and derived decisions. The pipeline reads completed rubrics only from `evidence/`, validates their query/source IDs against the current manifest, and disables response drafts when the calibration rubric is absent or stale. It never substitutes blank rubric values. Fail closed when input hashes, columns, split IDs or artifact versions disagree.

`automation-opportunities.csv` is the explicit bridge between both datasets: Dataset 1 supplies volume, valid post-response interval, satisfaction evidence and human-only constraints; Dataset 2 supplies measured classifier quality and safe coverage for the reusable classification pattern. It must never pretend the IT taxonomy predicts Customer Support labels or join records across datasets.

- [ ] **Step 3:** Run only the focused integration test and changed-file lint locally, commit and push the feature checkpoint, then run the full suite and reproduction in the managed Codespace. Apply the same reuse/cap check from Task 1 before `create-run`:

```bash
.venv/bin/pytest tests/test_workflow.py -q
.venv/bin/ruff check scripts/reproduce.py tests/test_workflow.py
git add -f submissions/luis-roquette/solution/002-support/scripts/reproduce.py \
  submissions/luis-roquette/solution/002-support/tests/test_workflow.py \
  submissions/luis-roquette/process-log/002-support.md
git commit -m "feat: reproduce support copilot artifacts"
git push
codespace-manager create-run luisroquette/ai-master-challenge submission/luis-roquette-002-support -- \
  'cd /workspaces/ai-master-challenge/submissions/luis-roquette/solution/002-support && make test && make lint && make reproduce'
```

Expected: tests and lint exit 0; all listed artifacts exist; the manifest records source hashes, row counts, split IDs, random seed, package versions, model versions and thresholds. `risk-policy.json` records category rules, priority formula, rule version and justification.

- [ ] **Step 4:** Do not commit generated models or raw data. If the remote gate fails, fix the root cause, rerun focused local tests, commit the correction, push it, and repeat the same managed command.

### Task 8: Build the agent-first Streamlit workflow

**Estimate:** 45 minutes

**Files:**
- Replace: `app.py`
- Create: `src/support_copilot/ui.py`
- Modify: `.streamlit/config.toml`
- Modify: `tests/test_workflow.py`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: versioned artifacts, `RouteDecision`, `TicketRetriever`, SQLite store functions and scenario calculations.
- Produces: queue, scorecard, IT classification demo, evidence view and auditable human actions; it never trains or mutates thresholds.

- [ ] **Step 1:** Add failing Streamlit `AppTest` cases to `tests/test_workflow.py`: queue is the initial page; a stale manifest shows path/cause/`make reproduce`; reject without reason is blocked; approve persists an audit row; scorecard labels projections separately; IT free-text input returns category, calibrated confidence and gate decision; unsupported Customer Support classification is shown as evidence, not hidden. Run the file and confirm failure before creating `ui.py`.
- [ ] **Step 2:** Implement four `st.Page` callables in `ui.py`: `render_queue`, `render_scorecard`, `render_it_lab`, and `render_evidence`. Register them with `st.navigation` in `app.py`; the queue is first. Add `load_artifacts(root)` in `ui.py` to validate manifest hashes and versions before page rendering; show explicit loading, unavailable and stale states with path, cause and `make reproduce` as the correction.
- [ ] **Step 3:** In the queue, load the sanitized test queue and show filters for gate, priority and predicted category. Selecting a row must show context, probabilities, model/version, threshold, risk reasons, similar ticket IDs/scores and the editable historical-resolution draft or an explicit abstention.
- [ ] **Step 4:** Put the four human actions in one form: approve, edit and approve, reject, escalate. Require a reason for reject/escalate; save through `record_decision`; show the inserted audit ID. Do not expose any send/close control.
- [ ] **Step 5:** The scorecard must use three titled sections: `Histórico observado`, `Desempenho medido` and `Cenários projetados`. Scenario inputs are annual eligible volume, addressable share, minutes saved and hourly cost; show conservative, base and optimistic presets side by side, while keeping every premise editable and visually separate from observed facts. The IT Lab must accept free text and show eight-class prediction, calibrated confidence, gate decision, per-class metrics, confusion matrix data and risk-versus-coverage. Evidence must show manifest versions and offer audit CSV download.
- [ ] **Step 6:** Run workflow tests, then a bounded health smoke that always terminates the server:

```bash
.venv/bin/pytest tests/test_workflow.py -q
(.venv/bin/streamlit run app.py --server.headless true >/tmp/support-streamlit.log 2>&1 & pid=$!; curl --retry 20 --retry-delay 1 --retry-connrefused http://127.0.0.1:8501/_stcore/health; kill "$pid"; wait "$pid"; status=$?; test "$status" -eq 143)
```

Expected: app starts; a human action persists after rerun; no page displays a raw name or email; no action sends externally. From a clean checkout, `make demo` downloads public data, reproduces artifacts and starts the same app without credentials.

- [ ] **Step 7:** Commit:

```bash
git add -f submissions/luis-roquette/solution/002-support/{app.py,.streamlit/config.toml} \
  submissions/luis-roquette/solution/002-support/src/support_copilot/ui.py \
  submissions/luis-roquette/solution/002-support/tests/test_workflow.py \
  submissions/luis-roquette/process-log/002-support.md
git commit -m "feat: add support decision copilot interface"
```

### Task 9: Capture evidence and finish the submission

**Estimate:** 35 minutes

**Files:**
- Create: `../../README.md`
- Create: `README.md`
- Create: `evidence/metrics.json`
- Create: `evidence/operational-summary.json`
- Create: `evidence/screenshot.png`
- Modify: `../../process-log/002-support.md`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: verified app, metrics, process log, research and real screenshot/export evidence.
- Produces: evaluator-facing root submission README, technical solution README, sanitized evidence and a PR-ready folder limited to `submissions/luis-roquette/`.

- [ ] **Step 1:** Copy only sanitized JSON evidence from the latest verified `artifacts/` run into `evidence/`, confirm it contains no raw text or PII, then start the app. Complete one approve-or-edit action and one escalation, download the CSV, and capture a real queue screenshot with masked data. Record exact artifact hashes and audit IDs in the process log.
- [ ] **Step 2:** Write `solution/002-support/README.md` with exact prerequisites, `make doctor`, setup/run commands, dataset fallback placement, architecture, automation boundary, measured metrics, scenario assumptions, validation protocol, evidence links and limitations. State explicitly that first-response latency and total-resolution time are not measurable from Dataset 1.
- [ ] **Step 3:** Create `submissions/luis-roquette/README.md` from `templates/submission-template.md`, preserving all evaluator sections: Sobre mim, Executive Summary, Solução/Abordagem, Resultados, Recomendações priorizadas, Limitações, ferramentas de IA, workflow, erros/correções, contribuição humana and Evidências. Answer the director’s three questions in the first screen; describe the practical flow `ticket enters → validation → domain model → confidence/risk gate → retrieval or abstention → human decision → audit`; and link the technical README, live commands, screenshot, metrics, research, process log and Git history.
- [ ] **Step 4:** Re-read the canonical challenge, submission guide, CONTRIBUTING, template, SPEC and both READMEs line by line. Run:

```bash
rg -n -i 'customer name|customer email|@|api[_ -]?key|token|secret' \
  submissions/luis-roquette/solution/002-support/evidence \
  submissions/luis-roquette/README.md \
  submissions/luis-roquette/solution/002-support/README.md
git diff --name-only upstream/main -- | awk '!/^submissions\/luis-roquette\// {print; bad=1} END {exit bad}'
git status --short
git diff --check
```

Expected: no PII or secret finding; only intended submission files are changed; `git diff --check` exits 0.

- [ ] **Step 5:** Commit and push the complete intended diff:

```bash
git add -f submissions/luis-roquette/process-log/002-support.md \
  submissions/luis-roquette/README.md \
  submissions/luis-roquette/solution/002-support/README.md \
  submissions/luis-roquette/solution/002-support/evidence
git commit -m "docs: complete support copilot evidence"
git push
```

- [ ] **Step 6:** Run the full managed preflight on that exact pushed HEAD. Apply the Task 1 reuse/cap check before `create-run`, and make no file change after success:

```bash
codespace-manager list
codespace-manager triage luisroquette/ai-master-challenge
codespace-manager create-run luisroquette/ai-master-challenge submission/luis-roquette-002-support -- \
  'cd /workspaces/ai-master-challenge/submissions/luis-roquette/solution/002-support && test "$(git rev-parse HEAD)" = "$(git ls-remote origin refs/heads/submission/luis-roquette-002-support | cut -f1)" && make test && make lint && make reproduce'
```

Expected: SHA equality and every gate exit 0; the branch is ready for the PR without another file change.

Do not open or update a PR until all statements below are proven:

1. Both datasets are used under separate taxonomies and frozen splits; raw data and PII are absent from Git.
2. Diagnostics reconcile denominators and call the observable interval `post_response_hours`; projections expose every assumption.
3. Classifiers beat or honestly report failure against baselines; frozen-test metrics include calibration and risk versus coverage.
4. Critical/risky/invalid/uncertain cases always reach human review; retrieval abstains without safe evidence; no external send exists.
5. A real Streamlit session persists and exports human decisions; root README follows the official template; technical README plus screenshot reproduce that exact state; the PR title is `[Submission] Luis Roquette — Challenge 002` and its diff touches only `submissions/luis-roquette/`.

## Time budget

| Task | Minutes |
|---|---:|
| 1. Environment and framework proof | 20 |
| 2. Data validation and privacy | 30 |
| 3. Operational diagnosis | 45 |
| 4. Classification and calibration | 50 |
| 5. Risk and retrieval | 45 |
| 6. Audit store | 20 |
| 7. Reproduction pipeline | 30 |
| 8. Streamlit workflow | 45 |
| 9. Evidence and submission | 35 |
| **Total planned** | **320 minutes (5h20)** |

If a task overruns, remove visual polish or the Dataset 1 subject ablation first. Never cut privacy, frozen-test discipline, fail-closed behavior, process evidence or the evaluator-facing README.
